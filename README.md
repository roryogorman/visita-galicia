# Visita Galicia
## Purpose
There are two purposes in the creation of this website.
* This is my Milestone 2 Project which is part of the Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development Diploma course. 
This project demonstrates the skills and knowledge that I have picked up studying JavaScript & Inteactive Front End modules of th CI programme & combining thess skills with the existing HTML & CSS knowledge from earlier in the course.
* This website is also being built to market the tourism opportunities of Galicia, Spain. Galicia is the north-westernmost region of Spain but when it comes to tourism, it is not as well known as the major urban centres of Spain (e.g. Madrid, Barcelona, etc) or the Meditteranean coastline resorts.
The website will showcase each of the 4 provincs that make up Galicia and will give the user a guide to the attractions, hotels, restaraunts, bars, etc of each of the provinces.

The website is designed to be accessed and viewed on all smart devices, laptops & PCs.
