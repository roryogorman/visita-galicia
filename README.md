# Visita Galicia
## Purpose
There are two purposes in the creation of this website.
* This is my Milestone 2 Project which is part of the Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development Diploma course. 
This project demonstrates the skills and knowledge that I have picked up studying JavaScript & Inteactive Front End modules of th CI programme & combining thess skills with the existing HTML & CSS knowledge from earlier in the course.
* This website is also being built to market the tourism opportunities of Galicia, Spain. Galicia is the north-westernmost region of Spain but when it comes to tourism, it is not as well known as the major urban centres of Spain (e.g. Madrid, Barcelona, etc) or the Meditteranean coastline resorts.
The website will showcase each of the 4 provincs that make up Galicia and will give the user a guide to the attractions, hotels, restaraunts, bars, etc of each of the provinces.

The website is designed to be accessed and viewed on all smart devices, laptops & PCs.

### Design 
#### Colour Scheme
- To reflect the subject matter & aims of the site, I will be using bold & vibrant colours throughout the site. I feel that using these shades adds to the attractiveness of the site and is very appropriate.
- The colour scheme used is based on the Galician regional flag - a rich blue sash on a white background, with a crest which contains a Red & Gold shade. These colours ae traditional to the region and can be seen everywhere, from football clubs kits to traditional pottery.
- The colours used are:
    - a. #FFFFFF: A brilliant white.
    - b. #009ACD: Rich Electric Blue. 
    - c. #005AC1: Sapphire
    - d. #CDCDCD: Chinese Silver
    - e. #D90921: Lava
    - f. #BEAD04: Chinese Gold

#### Typography
- Two fonts were used primarily for this site - Roboto & Roboto Slab. These are two fonts that are commonly used in tourism websites and are both clean, clear & very readable and so I feel are appropriate for this site
- From researching other leading tourism websites for the region e.g. tourism.gal & galiciaguide.com, these sites use typography such as these throughout which makes their sites look very attractive.
- I had planned on using Celtic script typography (as Galicia is a Celtic region and this script can be seen throughout the region), however I was unable to import this font in.
- Throughout, titles were entered using Roboto Slab, with the main script in Roboto.


#### Imagery
 - As this is a tourism website, stock images of the scenery & environment of Galicia was used throughout.

### Wireframes
Wireframes were created using Balsamiq.
